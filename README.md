# StmtDiff
== DESCRIPTION:

This is a tree-differencing tool for identifying the within-statement changes. 
Currently, it includes a set of sample changes identified from JEdit, JDT Core, Maven, and Google Guice. 
Each sample is displayed in an html page, where:
  - two versions of a statement are shown in a hunk,
  - the changes in the statement are listed under the both versions of the statement,
  - the changes identified by ChangeDistiller are listed for comparison;
  - the edit script identified by GumTree are listed for comparison.
   
The source code will be uploaded as soon as I finish adding comments.

== Usage:

Download the sample set. Then, you can browse the samples by opening the index.html in the directory. Chrome browser is recommended.
