== DESCRIPTION:

This is part of a tree-differencing tool that identifies changes with a statement. 
Currently, it includes a set of sample changes identified from JEdit, JDT Core, Maven, and Google Guice. They are placed under the folder \examples.
Each sample is displayed in an html page, where:
  - two versions of a statement are shown in a hunk,
  - changes in the statement identified by the tool are listed under the both versions of the statement, including a html-format diff and a change list;
  - the changes identified by ChangeDistiller are listed for comparison;
  - the html-format diff and the edit script identified by GumTree are listed for comparison.

In addition, it includes several sample modified statements placed under the  \examples_maxscriptlength folder. Each statement has a large number of micro changes or a long GumTree script.

The source code will be uploaded as soon as I finish adding comments.

== Usage:

Download the two folder. Then, you can browse the samples by opening the index.html in each directory. Chrome browser is recommended.
